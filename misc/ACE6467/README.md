# POC
This challenge needs a good intuition (well not really, hehe), i mean like the clues are scattered accross files and we were forced to be a detective and remember all small clues in order to solve this challenge.

Initially we're given with 2 files, they are _**Readme.txt**_ and _**Start.jpg**_.

_**Readme.txt**_:
```text
Refer to the image to start your challenge.
```

_**Start.jpg**_:

There's indeed a clue in the metadata.

_**Start.jpg**_'s metadata:
(I used _**exiftool**_)
